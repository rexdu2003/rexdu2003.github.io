## On the Duality Between Sharpness-Aware Minimization and Adversarial Training (ICML 2024)
**Yihao Zhang**\*, Hangzhou He\*, Jingyu Zhu\*, Huanran Chen, Yifei Wang, Zeming Wei${}^\dagger$

Adversarial Training (AT), which adversarially perturb the input samples during training, has been acknowledged as one of the most effective defenses against adversarial attacks, yet suffers from a fundamental tradeoff that inevitably decreases clean accuracy. Instead of perturbing the samples, Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) perturbs the model weights during training to find a more flat loss landscape and improve generalization. However, as SAM is designed for better clean accuracy, its effectiveness in enhancing adversarial robustness remains unexplored. In this work, considering the duality between SAM and AT, we investigate the adversarial robustness derived from SAM. Intriguingly, we find that using SAM alone can improve adversarial robustness. To understand this unexpected property of SAM, we first provide empirical and theoretical insights into how SAM can implicitly learn more robust features, and conduct comprehensive experiments to show that SAM can improve adversarial robustness notably without sacrificing any clean accuracy, shedding light on the potential of SAM to be a substitute for AT when accuracy comes at a higher priority. Code is available at [this https URL](https://github.com/weizeming/SAM_AT).

## Adversarial Representation Engineering: A General Model Editing Framework for Large Language Models (NeurIPS 2024)
**Yihao Zhang**, Zeming Wei, Jun Sun${}^\dagger$, Meng Sun${}^\dagger$

Since the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable success, understanding and controlling their internal complex mechanisms has become an urgent problem. Recent research has attempted to interpret their behaviors through the lens of inner representation. However, developing practical and efficient methods for applying these representations for general and flexible model editing remains challenging. In this work, we explore how to use representation engineering methods to guide the editing of LLMs by deploying a representation sensor as an oracle. We first identify the importance of a robust and reliable sensor during editing, then propose an Adversarial Representation Engineering (ARE) framework to provide a unified and interpretable approach for conceptual model editing without compromising baseline performance. Experiments on multiple model editing paradigms demonstrate the effectiveness of ARE in various settings. Code and data are available at [this https URL](https://github.com/Zhang-Yihao/Adversarial-Representation-Engineering).
